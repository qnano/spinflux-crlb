The SpinFlux code was developed and tested in Python v3.7.10, running on Windows 10.

Steps:

1. Clone repository or download software from https://github.com/qnano/spinflux-crlb. If necessary, extract the code in the directory '/spinflux-crlb/'.

2. Install the Anaconda distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. 

3. We recommend creating and activating a new environment for spinflux-crlb, as follows:

    - Open the Anaconda prompt.

    - Run the following commands in the terminal:
    ```
        conda create -n vti_env python=3.7.10 anaconda
        conda activate spinflux_env
    ```

SpinFlux class
---
The SpinFlux image formation model and Cram√©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB), as derived in the publication, are implemented as methods of the class ```SpinFlux(theta, sigmas, roiparams, pinholeparams, scenario, N_m, illumination_doughnut)``` in ```spinflux.py```, with the inputs representing:	
   - theta: [thetax, thetay, thetaI, thetab]
		* thetax: Emitter x-position (m)
		* thetay: Emitter y-position (m)
		* thetaI: Expected signal photon budget under maximum illumination (photons)
		* thetab: Expected background photon budget under maximum illumination (photons/(m*m))
   - sigmas: [sigmaillum, sigmapsf]
		* sigmaillum: Standard deviation of Gaussian illumination PSF (m)
		* sigmapsf: Standard deviation of Gaussian emission PSF (m)
   - roiparams: [dx_i, Npixels]
		* dx_i: Camera pixel size (m)
		* Npixels: Amount of camera pixels per direction
   - pinholeparams: (K x 3)-array [x_p, y_p, r_p]
		* K: Amount of pinholes and patterns
		* x_p: (K x 1) array of pinhole x-coordinates (m)
		* y_p: (K x 1) array of pinhole y-coordinates (m)
		* r_p: (K x 1) array of pinhole radii (m)
   - scenario: Simulation scenario under consideration, which models the normalization constant (i.e. to benchmark against SMLM) and pattern-dependent or pattern-independent background.
		* 'fixed_budget': Scenario for which the signal photon budget is exhausted
		* 'fixed_energy': Scenario for which the illumination power and time are constant per pattern
		* 'fixed_budget_adaptedbg': Scenario for which the signal photon budget is exhausted, with pattern-independent background
   - N_m: (Optional) Amount of mesh pixels per direction, default set to 100.	
   - illumination_doughnut: If True, doughnut-shaped intensity patterns with a zero-intensity minimum in the center will be used for illumination. If False, Gaussian illumination will be used.	

For example, the SpinFlux class for two x-separated patterns can be initiated as follows:
```
#Parameters
L_illum = 546*10**-9        #Illumination wavelength (m)
L_emission = 600*10**(-9)   #Emission wavelength (m)
NA = 1.35                   #Numerical aperture
    
dx_i = 65*10**-9    #Camera pixel size (m)
Npixels = 10        #Amount of camera pixels in each direction of the region of interest
    
x_p = Npixels*dx_i/2            #Pinhole x-coordinate (m)
y_p = Npixels*dx_i/2            #Pinhole y-coordinate (m)
r_p = 0.21*L_emission/NA        #Radius pinhole (m)
pinholeparams=np.array([[x_p-4*r_p/2, y_p, 3*r_p], [x_p+4*r_p/2, y_p, 3*r_p]])  
    
roiparams=[dx_i, Npixels]
sigmas = [0.21*L_illum/NA, 0.21*L_emission/NA]              #Illumination and emission PSF standard deviation (m)
theta = [Npixels*dx_i/2, Npixels*dx_i/2, 2000, 8/(dx_i**2)] #Emitter x- and y-position (m), expected signal photon budget (photons) and expected background (photons/m**2)
    
N_m = 100           #Amount of mesh pixels per direction

sf = SpinFlux(theta, sigmas, roiparams, pinholeparams, N_m = N_m, scenario=scenario, illumination_doughnut=False)
```

To draw sample Poisson-distributed measurements in the region of interest from the image formation model, the method ```Sample(amount)``` is used. The argument amount specifies the amount of sample regions of interest to be generated.
For example, 100 sample regions of interest can be drawn for the above example code as follows:
```
sample = sf.Sample(100)
```

To calculate the Fisher information matrix, the method ```FisherMatrix()``` is used. ```FisherMatrix()``` calculates and returns the Fisher information and underlying photon counts.
For example, the CRLB can be calculated for the above example code as follows:
```
I, musum, signalsum, Bisum, EfBgsum = sf.FisherMatrix()
I_inv = np.linalg.inv(I)
CRLBx = np.sqrt(I_inv[0,0])
```

To generate CRLB data for single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to benchmark SpinFlux against, a class ```SMLM(theta, sigmapsf, roiparams)``` is provided in ```smlm.py``` with similar syntax as the SpinFlux class. For further details, please refer to the final section of this README.
